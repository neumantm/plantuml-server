     * Basically copy of InputStream.transferTo from Java 9
     * <p>
     * Reads all bytes from the input stream and writes the bytes to the
     * given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, the
     * input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
     * stream.
     * <p>
     * This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
     * writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
     * and/or output stream is <i>asynchronously closed</i>, or the thread
     * interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
     * specific, and therefore not specified.
     * <p>
     * If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
     * output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
     * written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
     * one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
     * recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.
     *
     * @param  in  the input stream, non-null
     * @param  out the output stream, non-null
     * @return the number of bytes transferred
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code out} is {@code null}
